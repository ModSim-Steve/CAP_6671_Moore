Military Tactical Planning Assistant
Overview
The Military Tactical Planning Assistant is a Python-based system that leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to support military staff officers in tactical decision-making. The system combines terrain analysis, force composition modeling, and tactical evaluation to generate and assess courses of action (COA).
Features

Terrain Analysis: Convert and analyze terrain data from simple Excel-based inputs
Force Composition Modeling:

US Army Infantry Platoon structure and capabilities
Russian Armed Forces Assault Detachment composition and tactics


Tactical Analysis:

Position evaluation for support and assault elements
Route planning with terrain and threat consideration
LLM-enhanced course of action development

Quick Start

Prepare terrain data in Excel format using the provided template
Convert terrain data to system format:

pythonCopyfrom src.map_tools.excel_to_csv_converter import excel_to_csv

excel_to_csv("path/to/your/map.xlsx", "output_map.csv")

Run tactical analysis:

pythonCopyfrom src.tactical_analysis.tactical_position_analyzer import TacticalPositionAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = TacticalPositionAnalyzer(terrain_data, objective_position)

# Get position recommendations
positions = analyzer.analyze_squad_positions(objective_position)
